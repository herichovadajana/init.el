(defadvice basic-save-buffer-2 (around fix-unwritable-save-with-sudo activate)
  "When we save a buffer which is write-protected, try to sudo-save it.

When the buffer is write-protected it is usually opened in
read-only mode.  Use \\[read-only-mode] to toggle
`read-only-mode', make your changes and \\[save-buffer] to save.
Emacs will warn you that the buffer is write-protected and asks
you to confirm if you really want to save.  If you answer yes,
Emacs will use sudo tramp method to save the file and then
reverts it, making it read-only again.  The buffer stays
associated with the original non-sudo filename."
